# HNL-start
First codes for HNL (thesis project)

23/02/2021 start let's do some shit hoping I'm not too stupid for this


23/02/2021 HNLClass.cc and HNLClass.h added

23/02/2021 provarobe.cc added -- this file should create a histogram of the invariant mass of mu and pi -- cannot run the executable (bad error: "./provarobe: cannot execute binary file: Exec format error")

08/03/2021 mass_epi.cc added - provarobe.cc deleted == this file plots invariant mass of e pi, seems working fine

09/03/2021 3 files added - codes for pt,eta both for pions and electrons at gen level - code for lost electrons when reconstructed -- I'm worried because all of these work
